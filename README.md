# algebra

Implementations of various algebraic objects. To begin with, I'm working on Lie groups and Lie algebras, specifically those relevant to quantum mechanics.
One goal here is to provide concrete implementations of some of objects (especially representations) that are only abstractly defined in textbooks.
For example, `lie_groups.su2.group_rep` implements an irrep of SU(2) of every spin.
